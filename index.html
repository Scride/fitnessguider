					<h1>Grow bigger lower chest</h1>
					<p>Most people automatically think the solution is to go right to an exercise that specifically targets the lower chest, or at least places more emphasis on it. But, what happens when you just perform a movement like a decline bench, or cable high-to-low fly? Yes, you might place a bit more emphasis on the lower chest, but will it result in more GROWTH for that round, big and thick look that you’re going for? That is what we are going to determine in this article.</p></div>

					<h1>Should you bulk or cut</h1>	
					<p>Today we are going to talk about something very important. Before you know it summer will be here and the last thing you want to do is miss that 4 – 6 week window where you should be getting RIPPED and ready to show off your gains! Am I right? But bulking and cutting goes much deeper than “looking” a certain way at a certain time. A lot of people just kind of fall into the category of “bulking” or “cutting” because they THINK they need to bulk or cut at certain times of the year…which is RIDICULOUS. Let me explain…</p></div>

				<div class="art_l">
					<h1>How to: lat pulldown</h1>
					<p>A lat pulldown is a great exercise that’s going to target almost the entire back, mainly focusing on width. However, you will also be involving other muscles in your back like your traps, rhomboids and rear delts, as well as the biceps to a degree. Keep in mind this article will only cover the OVERHAND grip version of the movement, and we will cover the UNDERHAND grip version in another article.</p></div>

					<h1>3 sets per exercise is killing your gains</h1>
					<p>Today I’m going to teach you something that’s going to turn your world upside-down. In fact, the majority of you are probably not going to like it because gym culture has warped our minds SO MUCH that bad habits have become the STANDARD when it comes to HOW you build muscle. We live in a world where MORE = MORE, and if we don’t at least touch every piece of equipment before we leave the gym, we feel defeated, as if our workout was sub-par in some way. But that couldn’t be further from the truth and here’s why.</p></div>
