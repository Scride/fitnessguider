				<h2> Keep you gains/maintain shredded </h2>

					We all know how much persistence and consistency it takes to get a great physique.</br>

					You have to hit the weights 3-5 times per week, every week, for at least 1-2 years.</br>
					You often have to also find time for a couple hours of cardio per week.</br>
					You have to watch what you eat, regulating intake to meet your goals of gaining or losing weight.</br>
					While some of us learn to enjoy the process, nobody ever said it was easy. It takes intense, regular work.</br>

					Now, how do things change once you’ve achieved the type of body you desire? Do you have to work just as hard to keep a good physique as you do to build one?</br>

					If that question doesn’t matter so much to you–if you’re like me and you just enjoy the fitness lifestyle–then maybe this one will catch your interest:</br>
					I have good news for you:

					It’s much easier to maintain a good physique and level of conditioning than it is to get there.</br>

					How easy, you ask?</br>

					Well, consider a study conducted by the University of Alberta with competitive rowers. After 10 weeks of weightlifting 3 times per week, 18 varsity female rowers were split into two groups. Both groups then did 6 weeks of maintenance resistance training, with one group training once per week, and the other twice per week.</br>

					The results? Both groups improved their strength in two exercises they performed each week, and maintained strength in the four others in their routine.</br>

					Yes, that’s right–according to that research, you can maintain your strength training just once per week. And that’s not the only study demonstrating this.</br>

					The University of Alabama at Birmingham conducted a study wherein subjects lifted weights 3 times per week (9 sets per workout) for 5 months, and then were assigned to one of three groups for the next eight months:</br>
					<ol>
						<li>No exercise at all.</li>
						<li>One weightlifting workout per week that consisted of 9 total sets.</li>
						<li>One weightlifting workout per week that consisted of 3 total sets.</li>
					</ol>
					Over the course of the following 8 months, group 1 lost muscle (of course), but both groups 2 and 3 were able to maintain most of the muscle they had gained in the first part of the study, and even increase their strength.</br>

					So, what we can learn from these studies is this:</br>

					You can not only maintain muscle and strength training only 1-2 times per week, you can actually make gains.</br>

					Sure, you won’t be able to make the same kinds of gains as you can training 3-5 times per week, but you can do better than most people think.</br>
					<h2>The program</h2>
					When you can only train twice per week, I recommend you use one day to train your push and pull muscles, and another day to focus on your legs, with a little additional push.</br>

					The following workouts take about an hour to complete. Rest 2-3 minutes in between each set, and take at least one day of rest in between each (two days of rest between each is ideal, I think).</br>

						Day 1: Push/Pull</br>
						<ol>
							<li>Deadlift: Warm up and 3 sets 4-6 reps (80-85% of 1RM)</li>

							<li>Bench Press: Warm up and 3 sets of 4-6 reps (80-85% of 1RM)</li>

							<li>Barbell Row: 3 sets of 4-6 reps (80-85% of 1RM)</li>

							<li>Military Press: 3 sets of 4-6 reps (80-85% of 1RM)</li>
						</ol>
						Day 2: Legs and Additional Push
						<ol>
							<li>Bench Press: Warm up and 3 sets of 4-6 reps (80-85% of 1RM)</li>

							<li>Squat: Warm up and 3 sets 4-6 reps (80-85% of 1RM)</li>

							<li>Hack Squat (sled, not barbell) or Leg Press: 3 sets of 4-6 reps (80-85% of 1RM)</li>

							<li>Romanian Deadlift: 3 sets of 4-6 reps (80-85% of 1RM)</li>
						</ol>
						This is a brutally simple and effective workout. With it, you should expect to make gains, not simply remain the same.</br>
